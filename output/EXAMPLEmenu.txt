Okay, let’s plan some delicious and balanced meals based on your heuristic! Considering your priorities – fiber, protein, healthy fats, and a variety of options – here’s a five-day meal plan incorporating your preferences and the heuristic’s guidelines:

**Day 1:  Mediterranean Delight**

*   **Breakfast:** Greek Yogurt with Berries and Walnuts (High in protein, fiber, and healthy fats)
*   **Lunch:**  Quinoa Salad with Chickpeas, Cucumber, Tomato, Feta, and Lemon Vinaigrette (Good source of fiber, protein, and healthy fats)
